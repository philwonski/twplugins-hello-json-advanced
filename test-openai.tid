!! Example

Basic OpenAI call to the chat completions endpoint. Enter your API key and the prompt you want to use, and click the button to see the results.

The only wikitext that is required to make the call and catch the reply is like this:

```
<$button>Test Button (click me):
<$hellojson command="ai-reply" prompt="prompt1" creds="creds1"/>
</$button>
```

Where prompt1 is a tiddler with the following fields:

|''model'' |the OpenAI model you want to use |
|''sysmsg'' |this is an instructional prompt you can optionally provide ahead of your actual prompt |
|''msg'' |this is your actual message for the Chat, for which you want a reply |

And the creds1 tiddler has the following fields:

|''apikey'' |your OpenAI API <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/">key</a> |


In this basic example, the widget will just drop the reply in the `reply` field of whatever tiddler has the prompt. So below we will transclude the reply with `{{promt1!!reply}}`. 

I also inject the system message and the model to make the demo quicker to try out.

Enter your OpenAI API key:<br>
<$edit-text tiddler="creds1" field="apikey" size="50"/>
<br><br>
Enter your chat prompt:<br>
<$edit-text tiddler="prompt1" field="msg" tag="textarea"/>
<br><br>

<!--🍔 The test button will update the reply field of the prompt tid 🍔-->
<$button>Test Button (click me):
<$action-setfield $tiddler="prompt1" $field="model" $value="gpt-4-0613"/>
<$action-setfield $tiddler="prompt1" $field="sysmsg" $value="You are a helpful assistant."/>
<$hellojson command="ai-reply" prompt="prompt1" creds="creds1"/>
</$button>
