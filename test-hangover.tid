!! Example

Inside the button widget below, I am invoking the hello-json widget with the command "hangover," as well as specifying two dates to compare. 

```
<$button>Test Button (Hangover):
<$hellojson command="hangover" day1="20200101" day2="20230101"/>
</$button>
```

The hangover command calls the free Wikipedia JSON API to get the number of views of the article "Hangover" on the dates specified.

The hangover command always creates the tiddler called "HangoverCompare" to store the data. We can also make the name a variable, such as for batch importing/creating.

I display the results by transcluding the tiddler called "HangoverCompare" with `{{HangoverCompare}}`.

<!--🍔 The test button will create a new Tiddler called HangoverCompare 🍔-->
<$button>Test Button (Hangover):
<$hellojson command="hangover" day1="20200101" day2="20230101"/>
</$button>

<!--🍟 Show the results by transcluding HangoverCompare 🍟-->
{{HangoverCompare}}
